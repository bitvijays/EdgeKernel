# EdgeKernel Evaluation Plan # 

  * Size <- compare size of system with 1 unikernel vs Size of alternatives + similar/identical example process
  * Latency <- compare the time it takes for application to boot and finish on my system vs alternative with similar application
  * Resource Consumption <- same as above but with CPU usage? 

## Other examples ## 

### Xen Evaluation ###
  * Benchmark against alternative virtualisation
  * Benchmark against same applications on single OS
  * Assess Overhead of system and Isolation between guests

  
### ClickOS Evaluation ###
  * Memory Footprint
  * Boot Times
  
### MirageOS Evaluation ###
  * Boot Time
  * Microbenchmark -> run the same code on different environments
  *
